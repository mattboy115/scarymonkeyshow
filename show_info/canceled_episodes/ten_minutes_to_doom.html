&quot;Ten Minutes To Doom&quot;<br>
by Rob Hummel<br>
<br>
FADE IN:<br>
<br>
EXT. SKOOL FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON<br>
<br>
High drama... Slow motion... The Skool BELL RINGS. It's three o'clock and all of 
the kids are heading home.<br>
<br>
As credits roll, we see ZIM walking happily. Dib and Torque Smacky stand nearby. 
Dib turns to Torque and says something. Torque CHUCKLES menacingly and throws a 
ball al ZIM. ZIM falls to the ground, dislodging his backpack. Everyone LAUGHS 
at ZIM. Slow motion laughter is creepy. Torque sees Dib laughing and gets 
disgusted at the unpopular kid's enjoyment. ZIM hits the floor and everything 
goes back to REAL-TIME as ZIM's PAK pops off of his back. Dib's eyes light up in 
shock al the sight and he quickly takes action. He holds it for a beat, awed, 
then runs off with it. We push in on ZIM's dazed face, into BLACK as he passes 
out.<br>
<br>
OVER BLACK:<br>
<br>
We hear a strange, alien HEARTBEAT. A CLOCK appears on the screen, counting down 
from ten minutes.<br>
<br>
ZIM (V.O.)<br>
Ughh... Whuh? My lifeclock? Why? Lifeclocks don't come on unless...<br>
<br>
EXT. SKOOL FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON<br>
<br>
ZIM snaps awake, frantic. He reaches around to feel his back.<br>
<br>
ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
AAAAAAAGH!!! My PAK!! IT'S GONE!!<br>
<br>
The CLOCK moves to the corner of the screen, where it will remain for the <br>
rest of the episode. The first thing ZIM sees are the faces of his skoolmates 
circled above him. All the kids point in one direction: down the hall. ZIM 
follows the pointed fingers with his eyes and sees... DIB, standing al the end 
of the hall and clutching ZIM's pak to his chest. Dib looks guilty as hell, 
realizing he's been caught. He bolts around a corner. ZIM chases him around for 
a few turns until he loses him in an open area with a huge crowd of kids, but no 
Dib. ZIM loses it, whirling about in the middle of the crowd, searching with his 
eyes.<br>
<br>
ZIM (SHOUTING INTO CROWD) (CONT'D)<br>
GIVE ME BACK MY PAK, DIB! I need it to LIVE! Without it I can only survive for 
ten minutes and the countdown has already started! I am NOT going to expire on 
this filthy planet because of youuu!!<br>
(ZIM notices that the crowd is staring at him)<br>
Ehh...forget all that &quot;need my backpack to live&quot; stuff. Yeah. Um, it's just 
that... uh... it was full of sandwiches, and I love sandwiches.<br>
<br>
Behind a nearby pillar on a raised part of a nearby building, Dib has overheard 
the whole thing. He cradles ZIM's PAK like it's taken on a whole new meaning. 
ZIM can be seen below.<br>
<br>
DIB (TO HIMSELF)<br>
This thing's even more important than I thought. Oh hi, Screamy.<br>
<br>
SCREAMY, a happy looking kid, walks by and stops in front of Dib. Immediately 
after speaking, Dib covers his mouth in horror of what he has just invited.<br>
<br>
SCREAMY (AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS)<br>
HI, DIB!! HOW YA DOIN!??!!<br>
<br>
The whole crowd, including ZIM, looks up at the sound.<br>
<br>
DIB (WHISPERING LOUDLY)<br>
No, Screamy! SHHH!!! Don't say any-<br>
<br>
SCREAMY<br>
HOW COME YOU'RE WHISPERIN', DIB!?!! HUH, DIB?!! HUH?! I LIKE YOUR NAME: DIB!!!<br>
<br>
Dib screams, terrified. He clamps his hands over Screamy's mouth, but then runs 
screaming at the site of ZIM pushing his way through the crowd towards him. Once 
again, ZIM arrives too late and Dib is gone. He grabs Screamy by the shirt.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
SCREAMY! Where did he go? Where did the little thief run to?!<br>
<br>
SCREAMY<br>
I DUNNO, BUT HE SURE DID RUN! AH YOU SHOULDA SEEN'IM! LIKE A GAZELLE! A GAZELLE 
I SAY! WOW, I SURE WISH I-<br>
<br>
ZIM flinches at Screamy's onslaught of sound.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Come on, Screamy, think! THINK LIKE NEVER BEFORE!! WHICH WAY DID HE GO?<br>
<br>
SCREAMY<br>
LET ME THINK! LET MEE...UHHH!! UHHHH!!!<br>
<br>
SCREAMY thinks about it. He thinks real hard. ZIM is insane with waiting for 
SCREAMY. The strain of thinking is too much and the top of SCREAMY's head 
explodes. Black smoke pours out. ZIM drops a moaning and twitching SCREAMY to 
the ground.<br>
<br>
ZIM (FURIOUS)<br>
NOOOOO! Feeble humans!<br>
<br>
ZIM's eye catches a security camera. Then another, and another. From the looks 
of things, the Skool is monitored by hundreds of security cameras. ZIM looks 
like he's just thought of something, and he runs off.<br>
<br>
INT. SKOOL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
ZIM bursts into the security room, waking the Security Officer, who sits in 
front of a huge bank of monitors.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Quickly! My backpak's been stolen! Everything that I am is in that PAK! My 
memory drive, my charging cell, my atmospheric processor! My ZIMNESS!<br>
<br>
The Officer just stares at him. ZIM rethinks his approach.<br>
<br>
ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
Heh. It also gots my baby brother inside!<br>
<br>
SECURITY OFFICER<br>
SWEET DONKEY! My baby brother was taken away in my backpack once, too! What can 
I do to help?<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
I need to find the thief Dib!<br>
<br>
The Officer turns to a keyboard and starts typing.<br>
<br>
SECURITY OFFICER<br>
I'm not really supposed to tell you this, but you kids are implanted with a 
homing chip so we can find you at all times...<br>
<br>
ZIM looks a little uneasy at this bit of information, but he's got more 
important things on his mind right now...<br>
<br>
SECURITY OFFICER (CONT'D)<br>
Ha! Found him...<br>

<br>
EXT. SKOOL - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Dib gets dragged off into the streets. Shortly after, ZIM explodes from the 
skool, having escaped the beating, with Torque no far behind.<br>
<br>
TORQUE<br>
TAKE IT BACK! TAKE BACK THE DOOKIEWEENIE!! Ahhhhhhh!<br>
<br>
ZIM runs into a crowd of pedestrians, ditching Torque for the moment. ZIM stops 
to catch his breath against the leg of a standing pedestrian.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
So... weak... No! My body shell... is already starting to deteriorate! My 
amazing intelligence... draining. Must reconnect with brain.<br>
<br>
TORQUE<br>
ZIM!<br>
<br>
ZIM's been spotted, and now he runs again, desperately looking around for a way 
out. ZIM spots something that gives him hope. He sprints madly and leaps... 
directly into THE FATTEST SUMO WRESTLER WE HAVE EVER SEEN. He sinks into his 
girth. Torque walks by, confused. He looks for ZIM but can't find him anywhere. 
He runs off.<br>
<br>
Beat.<br>
<br>
Another beat.<br>
<br>
Finally, ZIM's fist shoots out from between two folds of flesh on the SUMO 
WRESTLER. Triumphant music plays. His face pops up, gasping for air. He flops to 
the ground. He looks up to see Torque, a block away. Torque doesn't see ZIM. ZIM 
looks around. He's running out of time. He spots GAZ playing a NINJA FIGHTING 
video game in an ARCADE.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
The sibling. Maybe she could... No! An INVADER needs help from no... helper!<br>
<br>
He coughs sickly and wobbles woozily, steadying himself on a nearby doggy. He 
looks desperate.<br>
<br>
INT. CITY BUS - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Dib, sitting on the bus, getting many stares, has finally contained the wild 
PAK, holding it tight against his chest. The PAK suddenly stops struggling. Dib 
looks alarmed, then relaxes, glad the resistance is over with for now.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Well, I guess I wore this thing out. I... huh?<br>
<br>
He tugs al the PAK and finds that it's stuck to his chest, attached by two 
strong cables that seem to actually go INTO him! He rolls around on the floor, 
pulling at the thing. He eventually calms down.<br>
<br>
DIB (CONT'D)<br>
Okay... don't panic... Dad'll know how to get this off. I just have to get to 
his lab... and then take over the filthy Earth.<br>
<br>
Dib slaps his hands over his mouth, shocked to have just spoken these words.<br>
<br>
INT. VIDEO GAME ARCADE - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
The arcade has no front wall and Gaz plays a game nearest the sidewalk. A half 
dead ZIM wobbles dangerously, riding the doggy like a horse. The dog stops and 
ZIM flops off to the sidewalk, lying face up. Gaz stares at him then gives him a 
lazy kick to the side. He quickly shoots upright, then immediately goes more 
slack. His eyes look off in two different directions. His speech is slurred and 
almost incoherent.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
(all one stream of words...)<br>
Dibsister! Dib stole my backpak and he takes it to your father's lab for 
experimenting on it and if I don't get it back soon, I won't live no more filthy 
earth human.<br>
<br>
GAZ<br>
You're not making any sense.<br>
<br>
ZIM (EVEN MORE SLURRED)<br>
Backpak have brain thing make ZIM act like ZIM. Need pak to think stuff.<br>
<br>
GAZ<br>
Oh yeah... That's MUCH better.<br>
<br>
ZIM beats his head against the wall, knocking his eyes back into alignment. Gaz 
turns her head at the sound of her game (that she had been ignoring since ZIM 
arrived) ending. ZIM sees the GAMESLAVE 2 poking out of Gaz's pocket and 
snatches it while she's distracted. He stuffs it into his pocket.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
He also stole your Game device and wants to experiment on it too!<br>
<br>
Gaz searches her pocket. She looks furious.<br>
<br>
GAZ<br>
Where did you say he was going?<br>
<br>
ZIM has started to go wall-eyed again.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Can't tell you... have to SHOW you... ZIM weak... need Dibsister to carry.<br>
<br>
Gaz looks angry... she finally grabs ZIM by the ankle and drags him like a doll 
down the street.<br>
<br>
INT. MEMBRANE'S LAB - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
MEMBRANE and another scientist stand next to each other. They have identical 
workstations, each with a brain in a tray. Next to each of them stand inactive 
robots with empty heads. A tense crowd of lab technicians watches. One of them 
holds a stopwatch. Membrane completes whatever he is doing to HIS brain before 
the other scientist and stuffs the brain into the robot on his side. The robot 
springs to life.<br>
<br>
ROBOT<br>
I am FOODIO, the robot that will end world hunger. OFF I GO!<br>
<br>
FOODIO runs off. The stopwatch holder clicks to stop the timer and holds 
Membrane's arm up victoriously. The crowd cheers Membrane, while the other 
scientist grudgingly hands Membrane a wad of cash. The crowd leaves the room. 
Membrane poses heroically as cameras zoom in from seemingly nowhere to snaps his 
picture. Dib runs in, scaring the cameras away.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Dad!<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
How did you get in here, little boy?<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Dad, it's me, ZIM! I mean Dib! I want you to have a look at this! NOW LOOK, 
FILTHY HUMAN! I mean... dad.<br>
<br>
He gestures towards the PAK on his chest.<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
Son, I don't like to get involved in your fashion matters, but that big metal 
shirt of yours is-<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
IT'S NOT A SHIRT! It's taking over my inferior human mind! You have to analyze 
it! I'm sure you'll be amazed.<br>
<br>
Dib activates the spider legs to show off the technology.<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
FASCINATING! Perhaps just a quick look.<br>
<br>
EXT. STREET LEADING TO MEMBRANE LABS - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Gaz rides a motorcycle with a feeble ZIM hanging on behind her and an <br>
exceptionally safe looking helmet on her head. The sound is deafening.<br>
<br>
ZIM (REALLY OUT OF IT)<br>
...hurry....there don't be enough time left...life...draining...ZIM..<br>
<br>
Gaz speeds up, looking angry and determined.<br>
<br>
INT. MEMBRANE'S LAB - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Membrane uses some scanning tools and probes at the PAK.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
It's some kind of parasite! Get it off before... I AM ZIM! Hurry, dad! It's 
doing something to my brains!<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
I've almost got it off of you here...<br>
<br>
EXT. MEMBRANE LABS - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Gaz zooms past the guards, riding ZIM like a horse. ZIM looks exhausted and 
drooly, and then confused.<br>
<br>
INT. MEMBRANE'S LABS - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Careful... Dad, do you know what this means? This device... it IS ZIM. It's his 
brain and his life support. That means his body is just.... something to carry 
his PAK around. It's... I AM ZIM AND I WILL RULE YOU ALLLLL!!!<br>
<br>
He uses the legs to push Membrane over. Dib, with robot legs protruding from his 
belly, scuttles away towards the remaining robot from earlier.<br>
<br>
Gaz bursts into the lab.<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
Gaz! Your brother wants to rule us all! We have to stop him!<br>
<br>
GAZ<br>
Yeah Yeah. He stole my GameSlave and now he's gonna pay.<br>
<br>
ZIM flops through the door looking barely alive. He drools sick goo. The counter 
is down to about thirty seconds.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
...give up, Dib...ZIM here now...prepare for...Floooooooog. ZIM FLOOOOOOG!! 
DuuhhhhHHHhh...<br>
<br>
Dib does some quick work on the robot brain, laughing evilly all the while. He 
plops the brain into the robot and the robot comes to life, looking insane and 
spooky.<br>
<br>
ROBOT #2<br>
I AM DESTRUCTIO! THE ROBOT THAT WILL END ALL LIFE ON EARTH! OFF I GO!!<br>
<br>
Destrucio smashes through a wall and runs into the city. Dib rubs his hands 
evilly, enjoying his work.<br>
<br>
PROFESSOR MEMBRANE<br>
Noooooo!<br>
<br>
ZIM (WELLING UP SOME STRENGTH)<br>
Dibsister! Attack!!<br>
<br>
GAZ<br>
Give me my GameSlave back now and I'll let you keep ONE of your limbs, Dib.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
BLUUAAAAAGH?!!<br>
<br>
Dib is too busy LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY to notice his sister's threats. When her 
rage reaches its peak, she leaps up, executes a series of ninja moves and knocks 
the backpak off of Dib. It falls to the ground right next to ZIM. Stupid ZIM 
looks at it for a moment as though trying to remember what it is. He stumbles 
over and picks it up. He tries to put in on his head like a hat. The clock is 
counting down... five seconds, four... he ties to stand on it... three, two... 
finally, he puts it on his back. The clock stops with one second left on it. 
ZIM's body rejuvenates, looking full and healthy green again. His eyes flash as 
the data floods back into him. He levitates for a second, full of power.<br>
<br>
ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
I AM ZIM!<br>
<br>
Dib raises his head to see the victorious ZIM.<br>
<br>
ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
You have no idea what you were toying with, Dib. Your filthy human body 
chemistry isn't compatible with the PAK. It would've destroyed you! You're lucky 
I defeated you. HAH!!<br>
<br>
He raises his arms in victory. As he raises his arms, the GameSlave falls out of 
his pocket. Gaz, standing over her dazed brother and preparing to make good on 
her threat of limb removal, sees this and her eyes go wide with anger.<br>
<br>
ZIM sees the advancing wave of evil that is Gaz, SHRIEKS and runs away. Gaz 
chases him through the hole in the wall left by Destructio. Dib watches them go, 
then remembers something very important.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
OH NO! I MUST STOP DESTRUCTIO!<br>
<br>
Dib runs out to stop the monster. Membrane is alone in his ruined laboratory. He 
shakes his head sadly.<br>
<br>
MEMBRANE<br>
That boy and his friends...<br>
<br>
Another wall comes down, revealing a furious Torque Smacky, still running after 
ZIM. He runs through the hole that ZIM and Gaz just left from.<br>
<br>
Torque<br>
DOOOOOOOKIEEEEEWEEEEEENIE!!!<br>
<br>
Membrane turns the lights off and leaves the room, disgusted.<br>
<br>
end.</font></span></p>
