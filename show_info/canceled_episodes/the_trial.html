<span class="largetext1">EXT. PLANET JUDGEMENTIA - THE SPIKE OF JUDGEMENT</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">TITLE: &quot;PLANET JUDGMENTIA&quot;. We DOLLY over a
massive IRKEN</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">crowd making their way to the SPIKE OF JUDGEMENT, an
imposing</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">structure on the surface of the planet.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. SPIKE OF JUDGMENTIA - THE SPIKE OF JUDGEMENT.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">Someone ascends on a platform in the center of the
cruel</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">looking room. Three IRKEN CONTROL BRAINS hover before
the</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">bound and blindfolded figure. Huge Monitors announce
&quot;ZIM&quot;</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">in monstrous letters. Shadowy spectators watch from</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">balconies lining the spike's interior. Very impressive.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">IRKEN: ZIM. Your time has come. Prepare</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">yourself for all you deserve.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM's restraints detach. His blinders remove
themselves. He</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">looks around, noticing the crowd behind him and the
images of</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">his face and name that are displayed on huge floating</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">monitors.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Heyyy, a surprise party? Is that what</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">this is all about? I was wondering why I</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">was beaten up and transported from Earth</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">to this place! A PARTY FOR ZIM!!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">SILENCE! All will be made clear, ZIM!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">Their eyes glow strangely, their voices ECHO ominously</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">throughout the chamber.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (IRRITATED)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Geeez, this is a party, lighten up. Hey,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">can I make a quick call?</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. ZIM'S HOUSE - DAY</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR sits watching some sort of monkey beast on TV. The
image</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">suddenly shifts over to ZIM at a callbooth on
JUDGEMENTIA.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">MONKEY?! DON'T LEAVE ME, MONKEY!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (ON MONITOR)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Forget the stinking monkey, GIR. The</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Tallest invited me to this &quot;party,&quot; and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">it's dead like death.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">That's soo saaaad.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (ON MONITOR)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Until I get back, YOU'RE in charge of the</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">deadly orbital laser. It's simple: Just</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">push the button.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">A small pedestal raises up next to GIR. On top is a
button.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR (POINTING AT BUTTON)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Push the monkey?</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (ON MONITOR)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Yes, GIR... the button is a monkey.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR pushes the button. A window opens up on the screen
and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">we see the DEADLY ORBITAL LASER ARRAY displayed within.
It</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">sends a glowing stream of doom at the earth.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">WOO!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (ON MONITOR)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">See? Easy. You just keep doing that</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">until I get back. Good work, GIR.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR salutes, and gives a huge thumbs up while insanely</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">pressing the button. ZIM cuts the transmission.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. PLANET JUDGEMENTIA - THE SPIKE OF JUDGEMENT</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM rises from below and turns to the BRAINS.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">C'mon, hurry up and praise me! Every</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">second I spend off Earth is time lost!</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM TIME! Cuz...I AM ZIM!! Ya know?</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">LEFT BRAIN</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">It makes noises.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RIGHT BRAIN</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Bothersome noises</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">We say nothing until the TALLEST arrive.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">There's a SCREAMING BOOM of the Massive as it flies in
and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">pulls up above the Spike of Judgement.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">The TALLEST have arrived.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The TALLEST teleport down, much to the joy of the
crowd. RED</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">and PURPLE make their way towards a central podium.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RED (TO CROWD)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Thank you, thank you.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE (TO CROWD, LOUDER THAN NECESSARY)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Now BE QUIET!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The crowd is instantly quiet.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">MY TALLEST! This really IS a surprise</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">party! You honor me deep in the most</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">wobbly, gelatinous parts of my</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">squeedlyspooch!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The TALLEST shoot ZIM the nastiest looks. ZIM is
oblivious.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE (TO BRAINS)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">That's great ZIM. Start already!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">As you command. SO IT BEGINS.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The crowd ROARS. CAMERAS converge on ZIM. The BRAINS'
eyes</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">glow red and the lighting changes, focusing on ZIM. It
looks</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">cooool. ZIM waves to the cameras.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (OMINOUSLY)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">IRKEN ZIM: Prepare for REPLAY. All your</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">memories will be made known. Your life</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">for all to see and know.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Ooooh..MY incredible ZIM-life? NEAT!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The BRAINS's eyes glow strangely. The TALLEST share a
creepy</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">evil look. Cables snake out from a creepy monitor array</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">above ZIM and lock onto his I.D. PAK It lifts him up
and the</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">monitors light up, showing images from ZIM'S PAST. The</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">images flash faster and faster.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">NOW, SEE YOUR PAST ZIM... YOUR PAST...</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (EXCITED)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">MY FUTURE?!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">NO! Your PAST! Pay attention!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">BLACKNESS.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">Voices are heard. (The following is the dialogue from
the</span><br>

<br>
<span class="largetext1">A chute moves into position above a DOWNLOAD CHAIR.
Tiny,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">cute ZIM flops out of the chute and into the chair. He
looks</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">about him, wide-eyed and curious.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ELECTRONIC VOICE (O.S.)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">You are two minutes old, little smeet.</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Prepare to be filled with the whole of</span><br>

<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (CUTE AS A SMEET)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">okeedokee.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The machine attaches to ZIM and he briefly shuts down
as</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">information courses into him. He spasms and jerks with
the</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">incoming knowledge. It stops. He wakes.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ELECTRONIC VOICE (O.S.)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">UPLOAD COMPLETE! You have been given a</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">name. IDENTIFY YOURSELF.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">ZIM (BLINKS FOR A BEAT)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I AM ZIM!! That was ALL the knowledge?</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">BORING!! And so many mistakes! 40</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">shmillion mistakes to be exact, starting</span><br>

<br>
<span class="largetext1">Robotic fingers come out and shove him from the chair.
As</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">soon as the chair is vacant, another smeet drops into
it.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I wasn't done yet! HEY WHO ARE YOU?!</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">SMEET (CONFUSED)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Ummm...</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">This is MY room. Get your own place!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM shoves the little IRKEN back into the delivery
chute.</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">The chute clogs with more smeets until the entire
activation</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">chamber malfunctions, sparking and smoking. We pull up</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">through many layers of cybernetic earth, to the -</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">EXT. IRKEN SURFACE, WAY UP THERE - CONTINUOUS</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The city, mighty and lit up, is enveloped in monstrous
ARCS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">OF ENERGY and is then dark and silent, except for
sirens.</span><br>

<br>

<br>
<span class="largetext1">All the eyes in the hall are focussed accusingly on
ZIM.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (O.S.)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">That day came to be known as HORRIBLE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">PAINFUL OVERLOAD DAY. IRK was plunged</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">into darkness for five years.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (BOASTING TO CROWD)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">IMPRESSIVE. Most would be happy with two</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">years, but me... FIVE!! Beat that, YOU!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM points to an IRKEN JANITORIAL DRONE, who mops
nearby, and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">looks up confused at ZIM's challenge.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT - SMALL DARK PLACE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The heads of TWO FIGURES watch the trial on a screen
from</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">someplace dark and nearby . We see only their
silhouettes.</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">They speak in hoarse whispers.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">FIGURE 1</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Shhhh! There's more!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">So... More ZIM. Come on! MORE ZIM!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. DEEP WITHIN IRK, MILITARY TRAINING AREA</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM is a little older now. He sits amongst hundreds of
rows</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">of young IRKENS, wearing holo-visors and downloading
new</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">data. They all perform military simulations. ZIM
removes</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">his visor and looks around, irritated.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Boring! Ten years and we're still in</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">this education plug! When do we get to</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">see the planet's surface?!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">He turns to the young IRKENS next to him, who happen to
be</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">cute, younger versions of RED and PURPLE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">When I'M TALLEST, things will be</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">different.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">You? TALLEST?! THAT's CRAZY!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">The people of IRK must know my POWER!</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE!</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">(points to a young SKOODGE)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">You look impressionable.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I sure am!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Escape with me to the surface!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE (TERRIFIED BUT OKAY)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Sounds terrifying, but OKAY!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The two run off, happy as can be. Idiots.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. DEEP WITHIN IRK, HATCH OF SOME SORT</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM and SKOODGE dump out of a porthole into a
mechanical</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">clearing between levels. They've been running.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">We're almost there SKOODGE! Can't you</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">feel it, you fool!??</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE (REALLY FEELING IT)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I DO! I DO!! I AM FEELING IT TOO-DAY!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">A SECURITY DROID leaps into the room and stares at the
two.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Quick, SKOODGE. Name that machine.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE (AS THOUGH BEING QUIZZED)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">DERMIS PROWLER SECURITY DROID.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (KEEPING VERY STILL)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Good. And how do they function??</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Detects motion. Homes in. Hurts A LOT.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">GOOD WORK SKOODGE!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM throws SKOODGE down a corridor and the robot is
instantly</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">after him. SKOODGE dodges the robot, causing the robot
to</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">slam into various pieces of machinery. Each lunge
causes</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">more and more damage. An alarm goes off. ZIM quickly
ascends</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">a ladder. At one point SKOODGE is hurled up near ZIM.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">CATCH ME! IT WANTS MY BRAIN!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE drops back off screen as ZIM gives SKOODGE the
thumbs</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">up, not really even looking down at him. The explosive</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">damage resumes below ZIM as the robot pursues SKOODGE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">EXCELLENT WORK, SKOODGE!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM pokes his head out of the surface side of the
porthole.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">EXT. IRKEN PORTHOLE - DAY</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">We don't see what he sees, but it's bright and noisy.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (IN AWE)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">FREEDOM! Hmm... A PITIFUL WORLD, WAITING</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">FOR ME TO MAKE IT GREAT!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM smiles up at the light until a loud BOOM from below</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">distracts him. SKOODGE blasts screaming out of the
hole,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">chased by the robot. ZIM shakes his head, smiling at</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">SKOODGE. There is another series of BOOMS and then the
world</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">is plunged into darkness. The replay ends.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">That day became known as HORRIBLE PAINFUL</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">TALLEST MIYUKI or SPORK were here, they'd</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">say so, too.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Well, as a matter of fact, I call as a</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">surprise witness, TALLEST SPORK!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM gestures to the audience, where TALLEST SPORK rises
up to</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">be seen. The crowd gasps. SPORK LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SPORK</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Yes, I have returned from my vacation to</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">re-claim my rightful position as leader</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">of the IRKEN empire! ISN'T THAT NICE? My</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">first act shall be to pardon the mighty</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">and beneficial Invader ZIM!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (LIKE HE WON A BEAUTY PAGEANT)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Yeeehooo!!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM leaps off the podium. RED and PURPLE watch in rapt</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">confusion as ZIM runs out of the room.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">EXT. SPACE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM speeds away from the planet in his Voot Runner,
happy as</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">a pig, and bobbing as though to the happiest music
ever.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. TRIAL PLACE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">TALLEST SPORK has continued talking. RED and PURPLE
approach</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">him tentatively.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">SPORK</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">...and as my twenty-fifth act as leader,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I order the construction of the Invader</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">RED (SUSPICIOUS)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Heyy...waitaminnit...</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RED POKES at Spork. A hole pops in the side and SPORK</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">DEFLATES. It's been an inflatable model after all. RED</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">picks up the IRKEN equivalent of a TAPE RECORDER, still</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">spouting SPORK speech.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">EXT. SPACE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM's cruiser is hit by a tractor beam, HARD. ZIM goes
from</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">happy to shocked.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">INT. TRIAL PLACE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM stands at the podium in horrible chains and
shackles.</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">He's now flanked by two MAMMOTH GUARDS, twice the size
of his</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">previous guards.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RED</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Nice try ZIM.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I wanna know why he had an inflatable</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">We have our ruling...</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM bites his lip. The TALLEST look thrilled.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE (TO RED)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Man...no more ZIM. Just imagine that!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RED (TO PURPLE)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">I know...I've imagined it my whole life!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">OUR RULING: IRKEN ZIM's I.D PAK is</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">damaged and has led to a corrupt data</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">path. HE IS... A DEFECTIVE.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">RED and PURPLE look ecstatic. ZIM seems to shrink.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">IRKEN ZIM's data is not allowed to into</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">the collective. His PAK will be removed,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">and erased.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">But I can't LIVE without my PAK</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">PURPLE (LOUD AND INSINCERE)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">AWWW... WOW. Too bad. TOUGH ONE, ZIM.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM's PAK is removed. The data cables connect to it and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">start sucking out data. ZIM watches a monitor,
horrified, as</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">the data-stream is shown leaving a ZIM icon and flowing
into</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">a trashcan icon. His life is ending.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM (PANICKING)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">No... THIS IS A MISTAKE!! Have I</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">mentioned that I AM ZIM!!!??</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">The BRAINS' eyes flash with the data flowing into them.
We</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">INT. FREAKY CYBERNETIC ZONE - AUTUMN</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">This world inside of the brains is a virtual reality
void</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">where ZIM's memories flood out of portholes into the
surreal</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">techno-landscape. ZIM's voice echoes through the void,</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">ringing with familiar sayings from previous episodes.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Something wrong... so much... bad data...</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">passing through us all at once... cannot</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">SPARKS shoot out of the BRAINS. GIBBERISH is issued
from</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">their speakers.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM is suddenly released from his restraints. He looks
up in</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">amazement. The TALLEST watch, confused. ZIM's PAK is</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">replaced and he seems to gain energy from it.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (INSANE)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">INVADER ZIM, for your heinous crimes...</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">we declare you... THE MOST INCREDIBLE</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">BEE...aargh...THE MADNESS...</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE TALLEST just stare at the lunatic BRAINS in
disbelief.</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">ZIM turns on the charm for the cameras that float
around him.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">THE BRAINS (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">AND for being YOU, ZIM, we grant you ten</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">WOOOOHOOOOOO!!!!!! You guys really had</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">me going! Thank you, MY TALLEST!!</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">EXT. ZIM'S HOUSE - NIGHT</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">Everything appears to have gone back to normal on
Earth. A</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">car dumps GIR off out in front of his home.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">HUMAN #2</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Too bad about you being overthrown as</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">leader of Earth, and everything being</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">returned to normal. But hey....</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR listens very sincerely, nodding as he eats his hot
dog</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">and drinks his SuckMunky. He walks into his house. The</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">second the door closes, the ceiling opens and ZIM's
VOOT</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">drops into the hangar. The roof closes.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">INT. ZIM'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR sits on the couch, dirty with food and spilled
drink.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">Lookit this place. I leave and the</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">whole mission grinds to a halt! GAH!!</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">GIR raises his hot dog and squeals in salute. ZIM is
already</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">heading towards a rising elevator and doesn't look back
at</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR. ZIM just sort of waves.</span><br>

<span class="largetext1">ZIM (CONT'D)</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">Yes, yesss. It's good to see you too.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="largetext1">GIR drinks more SuckMunky and spills much all over his
doggy</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">suit. We push in on GIR as he reaches into his pockets
and</span><br>
<span class="largetext1">pulls out the medallion he was given earlier. Inscribed
on</span><br>
