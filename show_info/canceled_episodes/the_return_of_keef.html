&quot;The Return of Keef&quot;<br>
by Danielle Koenig<br>
<br>
EXT. SKOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY<br>
<br>
Hiding behind a tree, Dib takes notes as he watches an odd-looking child play on
the monkey bars.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Subject: Woozly, possible werewolf or-HEY!!<br>
<br>
Dib is suddenly splashed with a blue liquid. He turns to see a beaming ZIM
holding an empty container.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
HAH! Prepare for the end, Dib! You've just been splashed with my most diabolical
creation EVER!<br>
<br>
DIB (TERRIFIED)<br>
AAARGH!! IT BURNS!! I'M MELTING!<br>
<br>
ZIM (CONFUSED)<br>
Wait...that's not what it does.<br>
<br>
DIB (NOT TERRIFIED)<br>
Oh, oh yeah. So what DOES it do?<br>
<br>
ZIM (GLEEFULLY EVIL AGAIN)<br>
It causes anyone who gets happy to blow up! MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
But I'm NEVER that happy, especially when I'm covered in goo.<br>
<br>
ZIM looks at his empty bucket and looks back at Dib.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
You may have won the war, Dib, but you have not won the...the thing bigger than
war. I will create more happy popping juice and sneak up on you when you're
happy!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
I won't be happy until you're destroyed!<br>
<br>
ZIM (FLUSTERED)<br>
NEVER!! NEVERRR!!! AAAAGH!!!<br>
<br>
ZIM storms off. Dib looks after him, smug. When Dib turns to walk away, he sees
KEEF standing just an inch away from him.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Wow, Dib you're so lucky to be friends with ZIM! I was friends with ZIM once.
Those were the best days of my life!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Friends? Um, actually-<br>
<br>
KEEF (DREAMY)<br>
Isn't he just the best?!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Look Keef-<br>
(getting an idea)<br>
You know what, ZIM is the best. And I have something that'll make him really
happy. Wanna help?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Boy, DO I!? If I make him happy, ZIM might even let me come near him again
without taking my organs out! YAY!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Great, here's all you have to do! Just take this BRAIN ROTTER, and put it on
ZIM's head! Easy! ZIM loves these.<br>
<br>
Keef lets out a shrill squeal of joy and takes the BRAIN ROTTER. He runs toward
ZIM. Dib smiles.<br>
<br>
Keef, in his wild enthusiasm, runs into ZIM, accidentally attaching the Brain
Rotter to ZIM's ass.<br>
<br>
KEED (cont'd)<br>
Hey buddy! It sure has been awhile, huh?<br>
<br>
ZIM plucks the device off and glares at KEEF, who just smiles. ZIM sees Dib
hiding in the distance.<br>
<br>
Still hiding, Dib is surprised when KEEF slides in on his face, having been
tossed by ZIM. As soon as Dib looks for where ZIM went, ZIM, out of nowhere,
clamps the device on Dib's head. Dib runs around, screaming.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
ARGH! BRAINS...MELTING!<br>
<br>
ZIM laughs and walks off.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
WOW, look! He really IS happy!<br>
<br>
Keef drags Dib off.<br>
<br>
INT. DIB'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY<br>
<br>
Dib enters, a bandage around his head. He stops short when he sees Gaz, Membrane
and Keef watching TV. Only Keef notices Dib.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Heya, pal!<br>
(to Gaz)<br>
That's my friend Dib.<br>
<br>
Gaz growls. Dib pulls Keef aside.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
KEEF?! Um...I don't think us being friends is gonna work out. Go home.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Oh, okay Dib. I gotcha.<br>
<br>
Dib breathes a sigh of relief and heads to his room.<br>
<br>
INT. DIB'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Dib flicks on the light and is shocked to see Keef sitting on a new, second bed
across from Dib's own. Dib's room has been converted into a cheery happy place.
Keef sits on HIS bed and reads comics. Dib gasps.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Welcome to your room Dib! All that dark, spooky stuff was making you sad.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
WHAT THE?!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!!<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Aww... SOMEONE I know is GRUUUM-PEE! You get some rest so we can play with ZIM
some more tomorrow.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
ZIM and I are not friends Keef! I wouldn't be friends with him if he were the
last person on Earth! And he's not even a person!<br>
<br>
Dib throws Keef out of his window and buries him in all his happy KEEF posters
and such..<br>
<br>
EXT. MEMBRANE'S FRONT YARD<br>
<br>
KEEF (SHOCKED)<br>
Weeeee! ZIM and Dib aren't friends? I'm going to make them friends, and they'll
be so happy, they'll like me even more!<br>
<br>
EXT. ZIM'S HOUSE - NIGHT<br>
<br>
GIR is sitting in the yard, holding a fishing rod. KEEF walks up and sees GIR.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Hey, GIR!<br>
<br>
GIR's eyes light up, and he just points at KEEF, letting out a joyous squeal of
recognition.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
I missed you too! I need you to do something very important. You need to tell
ZIM to invite Dib over for dinner.<br>
<br>
GIR holds his head in his hands, shocked. He makes a joyous, shocked squeal of
insanity.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
But GIR, it will make ZIM happy and you want him to be happy, right?<br>
<br>
GIR bounces happily, and squeals like never before. HE gives KEEF a lunatic
thumbs and runs into his house.<br>
<br>
INT. ZIM'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT<br>
<br>
ZIM berates GIR.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Invite my filthy nemesis to sup at ZIM's base?! Into MY base for foodening?!<br>
<br>
GIR<br>
But he so nice. You just gotta give him a chance, and open up his head and sleep
in it like a squishy little bed.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
WHAT? Look, NO. Invite Dib over...that's insane, even for YOU.<br>
<br>
GIR shrugs and walks away. ZIM watches him, suspiciously.<br>
<br>
EXT. ZIM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
Keef has been looking in the window.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Hmm...I'll just have to think of something else.<br>
<br>
MONTAGE<br>
<br>
- EXT. ZIM'S HOUSE<br>
<br>
Keef, holding a bunch of balloons, rings ZIM's doorbell. ZIM opens the door and
sees the tag reads &quot;TO ZIM FROM DIB.&quot; ZIM grabs a vacuum pump, sucks up all the
air from the balloons and uses it to blow Keef off his property.<br>
<br>
- INT. MEMBRANE FAMILY BATHROOM<br>
<br>
A messy, just awaked Dib walks into the bathroom to brush his teeth and is
startled to see ZIM behind him in the mirror. Dib trips and falls in the toilet.
It turns out to be a cutout of ZIM, with a word balloon that reads &quot;I sure do
like you!&quot; Dib looks out the bathroom window and sees giggling, sneaky Keef
running away from Dib's house.<br>
<br>
- INT. SKOOL HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY<br>
<br>
ZIM and Dib eye each other as they walk in opposite directions down the hallway.
Suddenly, they are inexplicably drawn to each other and collide with a sick
thud. They are stuck together as kids laugh at them. Keef walks by and smiles.
Dib and ZIM look in their backpacks and find them loaded with magnets. They look
at each other confused and then, with anger, turn their collective gaze down the
hall toward Keef. They then struggle to detach themselves.<br>
<br>
EXT. DIB'S ROOF - NIGHT<br>
<br>
Dib looks through a telescope. Through a telescope's POV, we see a beautifully
calm distant planet. The telescope view pans down to see KEEF (accompanied bu
scary music) merrily approaching Dib's house. Dib panics and goes to his laptop.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
(to himself)<br>
Oh no Keef, you're not getting anywhere near my house. The security system is on
and-<br>
<br>
He turns to see Keef down below holding a megaphone (but still screaming as <br>
though he weren't).<br>
<br>
DIB (cont'd)<br>
Ahhh!<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Hi, BUDDY! I've got news for you Dib.<br>
(loud whisper)<br>
Top secret news.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Don't your parents wonder where you are?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Yeah. Anyhow, my news is about ZIM.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Yeah, yeah he's a great guy, I know.<br>
<br>
KEEF (OBVIOUSLY BEING SNEAKY)<br>
That's true, but the news is he's ready to talk to you. He wants to admit to
being a ghost or whatever.<br>
<br>
DIB (NOT BUYING IT)<br>
Oh he does, does he?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
He sure does. He's just bursting with wanting to-tell-you-ness. Are you bursting
with to wanting-to-hear-it-ness?<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
(flat)<br>
Yes. Yes, I am.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Great. ZIM will meet you tomorrow night al 7:00 al McMeaties.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
The McMeaties on Maple?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
No.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
The one on Haverford?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
Uh-uh.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
The Greenbush one?<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
No. This is fun!<br>
<br>
DIB (LOSING IT)<br>
No it isn't Keef! It isn't fun at all! Which McMeaties?!<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
The other one on Maple.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Fine.<br>
<br>
Dib goes back to his laptop and presses some more buttons. Down below, a giant
scoop-like mechanism picks Keef up and tosses him across the city.<br>
<br>
KEEF (cont'd) (O.S)<br>
(flying)<br>
See ya buddy!<br>
<br>
Dib uses his laptop to dial a number. It rings.<br>
<br>
INT. MCMEATY'S - THE NEXT DAY<br>
<br>
Dib enters and sees ZIM, none-too-pleased, sitting at the booth. Dib walks up to
him. GIR, sitting on ZIM's shoulder, eats his food from the top of ZIM's head.
Dib sits down. The scene rivals the diner scene in Heat- sort of. Dib and ZIM
speak awkwardly as their eyes dart around, aware of being watched. GIR's chewing
can be heard throughout.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
So, uh, here we are.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Yep. Keef says you wanted to tell me something.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Yes, yes. I sure do.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Isn't Keef just great?<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Boy oh boy, yes...So, I'm an alien.<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Hmm..I thought so. Well thanks for letting me know. Now we can be friends
forever.<br>
<br>
The two squirm and wince as they shake hands. Keef jumps in from out of nowhere,
excited and beaming!<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
I DID IT! You guys are friends now! YAY!<br>
<br>
DIB (MUTTERING)<br>
That's right.<br>
<br>
ZIM (MUTTERING)<br>
We sure are.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
I knew it! Now we can ALL be the best friends, and hang out all the time, and we
can rent an apartment in the city, and get a car with three steering wheels and
buy footy pijamas and-<br>
<br>
DIB (SUDDLENY FRANTIC)<br>
Oh no! Footy pijamas! ZIM! THE PLAN! NOW!!<br>
<br>
ZIM pulls out another container of the happiness goo, the very same used on Dib
earlier.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
AHAAA!!<br>
<br>
ZIM splashes Keef with the blue liquid. Nothing happens.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
-and we'll spin around and get sick, because that's just so fun, and we'll get
jobs fixing copier machines, and oh, it'll be- (extended dialogue)<br>
<br>
DIB (THROUGH GRITTED TEETH)<br>
Nothing seems to be happening.<br>
<br>
ZIM (TEETH EQUALLY GRITTED)<br>
He must not be happy enough. We're gonna have to make him happier.<br>
<br>
DIB (DREAD AND DISGUST)<br>
You mean...?<br>
<br>
ZIM (MUCH DISGUST AND HATE)<br>
Yes....<br>
<br>
ZIM reluctanly stands up. Dib starts a weak game of paddy cake with him. Their
hands are all over the place and they're mumbling different words. (overlapping
extended dialogue) It's pathetic.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
OH WOW! LOOKIT THAT! You're even better friends than I thought! WOW!!<br>
<br>
DIB (STRAINED)<br>
He's still not popping.<br>
<br>
ZIM (HURTING)<br>
We'll have to do more.<br>
<br>
ZIM angrily begins an awkward jig. Dib locks his arm with ZIM's and jigs right
along with him.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
YAAY! SO HAPPY!! SO HAPPEEE!!!<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
I think he's almost there.<br>
(loudly)<br>
ZIM, you are the best friend a guy could have. What with your smart...arms nice
sense of... evil.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Thank you, good friend Dib. You too are a pile of friendship and a wonderful
display of human boy...nice.<br>
<br>
Keef, smiling huge, starts to shake but will not pop. In slo-mo, Dib and ZIM
move toward a hug. This is intercut with Keef's increasing shaking. Finally, ZIM
and Dib hug.<br>
<br>
Back to real time, ZIM and Dib watch slack-jawed as the insanely happy KEEF pops
like a balloon. The crowd in the restaurant gasps, until Keef reforms looking
woozy.<br>
<br>
KEEF<br>
It's okay everybody. I'm alright.<br>
<br>
KEEF passes out.<br>
<br>
ZIM and Dib, still hugging, realize what they're doing, kick at each other and
separate, looking sick.<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
Ahem...He'll be out for a few weeks, so I guess that's that.<br>
<br>
ZIM and Dib head out of the restaurant. GIR still sits on ZIM's head.<br>
<br>
EXT. MCMEATYS - CONTINUOUS<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Hey, you admitted to being an alien!<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
That was just part of the act.<br>
<br>
Dib pulls out a little minicamera.<br>
<br>
DIB (SUDDENLY EVIL)<br>
But I videotaped it!<br>
<br>
ZIM<br>
AGH! Is that hug on there as well?<br>
<br>
DIB<br>
Huh? Huh? Ahhhh!<br>
<br>
Dib looks at the camera horrified. He shrieks and smashes the camera on the
floor. ZIM takes the opportunity to kick Dib on the butt, knocking him to the
floor. ZIM runs off, and Dib, furious, chases him.<br>
<br>
