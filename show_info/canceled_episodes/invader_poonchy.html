            INVADER ZIM<br>
            #128A<br>
            &quot;Invader Poonchy&quot;<br>
            by Brent Crowe &amp; Rob Hummel<br>
            <br>
            FADE IN:<br>
            <br>
            INT. ZIM'S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM is in his front yard working on a mechanical monstrosity that looks very <br>
            much like a huge cannon. NEIGHBORS gawk.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (SHOUTING INTO THE HOUSE)<br>
            Hurry up, GIR. I need those hydro-spanners so that I can prepare the <br>
            new...<br>
            (notices the gawking neighbors)<br>
            ...bird feeder.<br>
            <br>
            A camera flashes. ZIM whirls to find Dib standing in the middle of the sidewalk
            with his camera.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
            DIB! I see through your disguise!<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            I'm not in disguise. And if this...thing is supposed to be secret, you're doing
            a real bad job keeping it that way.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            SILENCE!<br>
            <br>
            ZIM chases after Dib. Dib holds his camera away.<br>
            <br>
            INT. ZIM'S LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM storms in carrying Dib's broken camera. GIR, in his dog suit, sits
            motionless against the couch.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            That little spying weasel. Doesn't he have anything better to do than try to <br>
            save his planet from me? <br>
            (GIR hasn't moved) <br>
            You know GIR, you're supposed to be guarding the base against him!<br>
            <br>
            ZIM pokes GIR to finish his point, but GIR just wobbles there. After a beat, the
            suit collapses, revealing it is filled with ground beef.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
            AAAGH!! GIR!? GIIIR!! They've turned you into ground beef! HOWW!? WHYY?!<br>
            <br>
            The real GIR pops his head up from behind the couch.<br>
            <br>
            GIR<br>
            Fooooled you! Now there's two GIR's! That's BEEF GIR! LET'S EAT'IM!<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (THINKING)<br>
            Why would you...WAITAMINUTE! A decoy. Your insane idea has given me a brilliant
            one. If Dib thinks there is another IRKEN on Earth, he won't have as much time
            to interfere in the creation of my SUPER WEAPON. But WHO will be my decoy?<br>
            <br>
            GIR<br>
            I WISH I KNEW!<br>
            <br>
            A screen appears. Gretchen's face appears on it.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            No. Too normal looking. <br>
            (the shot changes to Zootch)<br>
            Hmmm... I DO like his hair...<br>
            (now it's Morla, ZIM just WRETCHES. It changes to Poonchy: Drinker of Hate.)<br>
            Poonchy... Yesss....<br>
            <br>
            INT. SKOOL HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CLASS.<br>
            <br>
            The SKOOL BELL rings. The door to Ms. Bitterss' class opens and students pour
            out. ZIM stealthily zips out and presses himself against the wall. When Poonchy
            walks out of the room, ZIM lurches forward and BUMPS into him, <br>
            dropping a notebook as he does so. On the cover of the notebook is an IRKEN
            insignia and the word &quot;Poonchy&quot;. Dib walks out of the class and steps over the
            notebook. ZIM picks it up.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (CLEARLY ACTING)<br>
            Oh, INVADER P-... uhhh... I mean, just regular skool child Poonchy, you have
            dropped your notebook.<br>
            <br>
            Dib looks back, irritated. Poonchy ignores ZIM and simply walks away. ZIM flips
            through the book, exposing IRKEN text and schematics. ZIM suddenly turns on Dib.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (CONT'D)<br>
            Poonchy? An alien? Dib, that's crazy!<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            What are you talking about, ZIM?<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            How dare you accuse that innocent non-alien child of being an IRKEN spy?<br>
            <br>
            Dib<br>
            I'm not in the mood for jokes, ZIM.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Heh?<br>
            <br>
            Dib turns and walks away. ZIM looks frustrated.<br>
            <br>
            INT. SKOOL CAFETERIA.<br>
            <br>
            The cafeteria bustles with kids eating. Dib sits by himself eating a bag lunch.
            Across the cafeteria sits Poonchy with several of his friends. ZIM stands in the
            door, surveying the situation. ZIM walks behind Poonchy and <br>
            slaps an IRKEN backpack on him. The backpack fastens itself INTO Poonchy, who
            writhes and struggles. He sits back up, dazed.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Hello there, my Poonchy friend.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM sits next to Poonchy. All Poonchy's friends see Poonchy sitting next to ZIM
            and they walk away in social horror.<br>
            <br>
            FRIENDS (WALLA)<br>
            Ew, I didn't know Poonchy and ZIM were friends. They even wear the same
            backpack! Let's go guuuuys.<br>
            <br>
            Dib looks up at the commotion and runs over to investigate.<br>
            <br>
            DIB (TO ZIM)<br>
            What're you doing to Poonchy, ZIM?<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            What do you mean? What's wrong with his alien-style backpack?<br>
            <br>
            Dib<br>
            I didn't say anything about backpacks...<br>
            <br>
            Poonchy rubs his back and kind of stumbles away.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY<br>
            ...My back hurts...<br>
            <br>
            Dib turns to follow Poonchy, but Zim grabs him.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            All right, Dib, you win. I, ZIM, am merely a decoy, sent here to distract you
            from the real INVADER... INVADER POONCHY!<br>
            (he turns to the wall and starts pounding on it)<br>
            Oh, I've failed you MASTER POONCHY!!<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            Okay, NOW you're just being weird, ZIM.<br>
            <br>
            Dib walks away. ZIM hasn't noticed. He's still pounding.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Curse you Dib, you're too clever...<br>
            <br>
            He looks up to see Dib's reaction and sees instead that the whole cafeteria
            stares at him. ZIM looks irritated.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM (PLOTTING TO HIMSELF) (CONT'D)<br>
            Fine, Dib. Looks like it's time for more drastic measures...<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT.<br>
            <br>
            As Poonchy walks up the walkway of his house, the dark figure of ZIM lurks
            around the corner. Poonchy rubs his new backpack and MOANS as he shuts the door
            behind him. ZIM listens at the door.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY (O.S,)<br>
            Mom, skool was CRAZY. I'm gonna go to my room and wind down with some video
            games, ya know? Yahhh, YOU knowww. Yeah!<br>
            <br>
            ZIM smiles and sneaks away.<br>
            <br>
            INT. POONCHY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS.<br>
            <br>
            Poonchy walks into his room, which is no longer his room. He is surrounded by
            IRKEN technology. There is a giant screen with what looks like video game
            controllers in front of it.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY<br>
            Coooool.<br>
            <br>
            INT. MEMBRANE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.<br>
            <br>
            Dib sits watching TV. The Mysterious Mysteries THEME SONG plays. Suddenly, the
            screen goes fuzzy and a shadowy form appears. It's ZIM in a lumpy disguise, his
            idea of spooky.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            What the- ?<br>
            <br>
            SHADOWY FORM (ZIM)<br>
            Agent Dib. I am Agent...eh...Loonypants he he from the Swollen Meatball Network.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            Swollen Meatball Network? I've never heard of any Meatball-<br>
            <br>
            SHADOWY FORM (ZIM)<br>
            SILENCE! We need you to investigate some alien signals in your neighborhood.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            Okayyy...<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - LATER<br>
            <br>
            Dib scales the side of Poonchy's house, talking to himself.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            I dunno about this &quot;Swollen Meatball&quot;. If tonight's Mysterious Mysteries wasn't
            a rerun I wouldn't even be here-<br>
            <br>
            He peeks his head up to look into Poonchy's room. He is shocked to see Poonchy
            sitting amid all the IRKEN TECHNOLOGY. From his POV, Dib can't see what's on the
            video game screen.<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            Now we see the video game screen in the foreground, with Dib peeking in the
            background. The screen is swarming with &quot;alien enemies&quot;. From his vantage point,
            Dib can only see the back of the screen and Poonchy playing his game.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY (ABOUT VIDEO GAME)<br>
            I'll destroy them all!!!!<br>
            <br>
            Dib's eyes go wide and he drops out of frame. THUD<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            Dib stares up at Poonchy's room.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            Poonchy really is an alien! And he wants to destroy us all!<br>
            <br>
            INT. VOOT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            High above, ZIM hovers in his VOOT CRUISER, watching. He can see Dib backing
            away from Poonchy's house. GIR sits next to him. ZIM chuckles to himself.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            HAH! I spared no detail to make Poonchy look like a real IRKEN. Now I can work
            on my SUPER WEAPON in peace.<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            Poonchy spots a read button on his console.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY<br>
            What's this button do?<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The top of Poonchy's house opens up, revealing the weapon thing that ZIM was
            working on in the opening scene. Dib backs away in awe.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            I've got to find help.<br>
            <br>
            EXT. VOOT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            ZIM is shocked as the weapon folds out.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Wow that really IS detailed. That looks just like my SUPER WEAPON...hey wait.
            That IS MY SUPER WEAPON! GIR! GIRRR!! Huh?! Huh?!<br>
            (GIR says nothing. ZIM pokes his head. Beef oozes out.)<br>
            BEEEEEEEEF!<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The game screen changes. ZIM's VOOT CRUISER fills the frame and a target reticle
            closes in on it.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY<br>
            I hope this game gets better...<br>
            <br>
            EXT. VOOT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The laser cannon fires super lasers at the VOOT. ZIM SHRIEKS and makes the
            CRUISER dodge the beams. The sudden movement jars beef GIR out of his seat. Beef
            GIR flops around inside the cabin as ZIM tries to control his ship. We CUT TO:<br>

            INT. TV STUDIO - LATER<br>
            <br>
            A NEWSCASTER sits at a news desk.<br>
            <br>
            NEWSCASTER<br>
            THIS JUST IN. An evil alien has taken over a local home and is firing lasers all
            crazy like. Authorities have the location surrounded. Reporter Ted Slunchy has
            the story...<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            Ted Slunchy stands in front of Poonchy's house, holding a microphone. Dib stands
            next to him. Bedlam reigns behind them as the laser shoots at the surrounding
            police cars and military vehicles.<br>
            <br>
            TED SLUNCHY<br>
            I'm here with Dib, the boy who reported the alien to the authorities. Dib, isn't
            it true that you have a history of making this kind of thing up?<br>
            <br>
            DIB (PERPLEXED)<br>
            No.<br>
            <br>
            TED SLUNCHY<br>
            Very interesting. I'm also here with Doctor Spanky, laser specialist. Doctor,
            what do you have to say?<br>
            <br>
            DOCTOR SPANKY<br>
            What we have here is a high impact-<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, from behind them, someone shouts.<br>
            <br>
            RANDOM VOICE (O.S.)<br>
            It's going into super deluxe attack mode! It could destroy the world!!!<br>
            <br>
            A light on top of the weapon DINGS from green to red. Ted pushes aside the
            expert. Pandemonium breaks out.<br>
            <br>
            TED SLUNCHY<br>
            You heard it here first folks. This impressive alien threat has &quot;Super deluxe
            attack mode&quot; technology! Possible worldwide destruction. RUUUUUN!<br>
            <br>
            The reporter goes running as everything dissolves into chaos.<br>

            EXT. VOOT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The CRUISER hovers high above the madness. The inside of the ship is coated with
            meat. ZIM has the newscast on a monitor.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Poonchy? Impressive?! But that's MY weapon! I MUST save the earth from POONCHY!
            Only THEN can I... destroy The EARTH! Computer, activate self-destruct for
            Poonchy's fake base!<br>

            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The cannon SPLITS OPEN and sparks start to shoot out of it. The crowd gasps. Dib
            yells at a GENERAL, who stands in front of a group of military mechs and <br>
            tanks.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            You're gonna have to destroy that house! You can't let the super cannon go off!!<br>
            <br>
            GENERAL<br>
            The boy is right!<br>
            <br>
            The NOISE level outside is intense as things EXPLODE, people SCREAM and cars
            CRASH. CUT TO:<br>

            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE, THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            For some reason, it's really quiet. POONCHY'S MOM sits at the kitchen table. She
            nods off. Through the window, we can see all kinds of crazy stuff going on.
            Behind her, the microwave HUMS. After a beat, the microwave DINGS. She <br>
            snaps awake.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY'S MOM (SCREAMING)<br>
            POONCHY! DINNER'S READY!<br>
            <br>
            INT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            Poonchy excitedly plays his game. In the corner of his screen, we can see the
            self-destruction countdown.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY<br>
            Not now mom, I almost got the super weapon all charged up. Something cool's
            gonna happen just as soon as I -<br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, his mom's in his doorway.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY'S MOM (INSANELY CHEERY)<br>
            I made fish sticks! Yum, yum yum yum yum.<br>
            <br>
            POONCHY (INSANELY HAPPY)<br>
            YAAHHH!! FISH STICKS!! Oooooooh!<br>
            <br>
            Poonchy unplugs the game, and runs off out of the room with his mom. The two of
            them happy about fish sticks.<br>
            <br>
            INT. VOOT CRUISER - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The destruction countdown stops on ZIM'S monitor.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM'S<br>
            It's shut down! Now I won't have to blow up the base! Oh well. Woulda been neat.<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS<br>
            <br>
            The cannon POWERS DOWN and stops firing.<br>
            <br>
            DIB<br>
            Look! I think he's surrendering!<br>
            <br>
            General<br>
            You might be right. Let's send in the ground troops just to be safe!<br>
            <br>
            Troops bust into the house. We hear Poonchy's mom SCREAM.<br>
            <br>
            GROUNDTROOPS<br>
            Heyyy FISHSTICKS!!<br>
            <br>
            EXT. POONCHY'S HOUSE - LATER<br>
            <br>
            Ted Slunchy once again stands with microphone.<br>
            <br>
            TED SLUNCHY<br>
            ...And in the end, it was really just a video game belonging to a normal boy...<br>
            (a picture of Poonchy fills the screen)<br>
            Who was falsely accused of being an alien by this boy...<br>
            (horrible picture of Dib)<br>
            ... who was hauled away from the scene after accusing this woman...<br>
            (picture of Poonchy's mom)<br>
            ...of being an alien robot.<br>
            (shot of Dib being pulled off of Poonchy's mom)<br>
            Even more mysterious was the green boy yelling at a dog stuffed with beef.<br>
            (picture of ZIM screaming at GIR)<br>
            They don't get any weirder than that!<br>
            <br>
            GIR, out of his costume and GIGGLING, floats by Ted carrying a load of ground
            beef. Ted watches GIR fly off-screen, and is immediately hit in the face with a
            wad of meat. The image goes to STATIC, as though a TV is being turned off. CUT

            INT. ZIM'S LIVING ROOM - LATER<br>
            <br>
            ZIM sits on the couch in front of his TV with his remote control in his hand.
            The room is covered in beef.<br>
            <br>
            ZIM<br>
            Well, with Dib in jail, he can't bug me for a while, so...I guess I win.<br>
            (beat)<br>
            SUCCESS!!!<br>
            <br>
            Zim shoves his fists in the air victoriously. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC swells until ZIM
            is slammed hard off-screen by a monstrous blast of beef. GIR giggles.<br>
            <br>
